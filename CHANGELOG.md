## [2.2.0] - 2026-XX-YY

### Added

- Adds a stereographic 2D rotary position embedding to `physicsnemo.nn`
  (`StereographicRotaryPositionEmbedding2D`) for tokens on a sphere:
  latitude/longitude are mapped to a local tangent plane via a stereographic
  projection and the resulting continuous coordinates drive a 2D RoPE that
  composes with the existing `apply_rotary_pos_emb`. Also adds
  `build_rope_cos_sin_2d` (the continuous-coordinate generalization of
  `build_axial_rope_cos_sin`), `stereographic_projection`, and `mean_longitude`
  to `physicsnemo.nn.module.rope`.
- Adds `DiT3D` to experimental models
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.strata.DiT3D`). A 3D transformer backbone —
  the 3D analog of `physicsnemo.models.dit.DiT` — combining 3D patch embedding,
  3D neighborhood attention (reusing `physicsnemo.nn.functional.na3d`) with
  optional depth-axis and gated attention, an anti-aliased patch-embed variant,
  and optional axial or stereographic
  (`StereographicRotaryPositionEmbedding2D`) rotary position embeddings.
  Despite the "DiT" name it is a **deterministic regression** model, not a
  generative diffusion model (no diffusion / timestep / class-label / text
  conditioning). Geometry is decoupled from construction: latitude/longitude are
  an optional forward input used only for stereographic RoPE, so the model has no
  hard spherical-grid dependency.
- Adds `PixelDiT` to experimental models
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.strata.PixelDiT`). A two-stage regression
  model: a `DiT3D` semantic stage (coarse patches) conditions a pixel-resolution
  stage whose blocks inject the semantic tokens via pixel-wise adaptive layer
  norm (`pixel_proj` or `bilinear_dw` modes). Adapts the pixel-wise-AdaLN idea
  from PixelDiT (arXiv:2511.20645) — an adaptation, not a faithful port: a
  deterministic regression model (no diffusion / timestep / label conditioning),
  an independent reimplementation of the AdaLN, with the original `bilinear_dw`
  conditioning path added beyond the paper.
- Adds Point-Transformer local vector-attention blocks to `physicsnemo.nn`.
- FSDP2 checkpoint support: full save/load round-trip for
  ``torch.distributed.fsdp`` v2 models, including DTensor edge cases,
  cross-mesh reloads, and optimizer state loading.
- Migrated the StormCast example from DDP + Domain Parallel  to FSDP2 +
  Domain Parallel. StormCast previously used ``FullyShardedDataParallel``
  with ``ShardingStrategy.NO_SHARD`` (equivalent to DDP) alongside domain
  parallelism; it now uses the FSDP2 ``fully_shard`` API, producing 2D-mesh
  DTensor parameters when ``use_shard_tensor`` is enabled.
- Adds tensor-returning `Mesh.gradient`, `Mesh.divergence`, `Mesh.curl`, and
  `Mesh.laplacian` convenience methods to `physicsnemo.mesh`, mirroring
  `Mesh.integrate` (each returns a tensor and accepts a data key or a raw
  tensor, with a `data_source="points"|"cells"` kwarg selecting vertex or
  cell-centered fields). This gives the discrete differential operators a
  consistent, discoverable surface on `Mesh`; previously divergence/curl/
  laplacian were reachable only as free functions in `physicsnemo.mesh.calculus`.
  Adds `compute_divergence_cells_lsq` and `compute_curl_cells_lsq` free
  functions (cell-centered LSQ analogues); DEC operators and the cotangent
  Laplacian remain vertex-only and raise `NotImplementedError` for cell data.
- Adds `farthest_point_sampling` to `physicsnemo.nn.functional`, a greedy
  farthest-point sampling (FPS) functional for point clouds.
- Adds `FourierPositionalEmbedding` to `physicsnemo.nn`, a deterministic
  axis-wise (NeRF-style) Fourier positional embedding for continuous
  coordinates with no learnable parameters.
- Adds radiation transport example (`examples/nuclear_engineering/radiation_transport`)
- Adds agent skills structure, and initial skill for 'discoverability'.
- Adds xDeepONet to experimental models
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.xdeeponet.DeepONet`).  A single
  dimension-generic (2D/3D) DeepONet that accepts a spatial or MLP branch,
  an optional trunk, and an optional second branch as `nn.Module` inputs
  (dependency injection).  Six forward-call conventions cover trunked,
  trunkless, packed/auto-padded, and xFNO-style time-axis-extend modes.
  Supports multi-channel output, multiple decoder types (MLP, Conv,
  temporal projection), composable Fourier / UNet / Conv spatial branches
  (`SpatialBranch`), and coordinate features.
- Adds `FNO4DWrapper` to the xdeeponet package: a thin wrapper around the
  library `physicsnemo.models.fno.FNO` (`dimension=4`) that adds
  autoregressive time-axis extension over `(B, X, Y, Z, T, C)` inputs (predict
  a `K`-step forecast horizon via `target_times`).  Use
  `physicsnemo.models.fno.FNO(dimension=4)` directly when the time-axis
  extension is not needed.  3D FNO / Conv-FNO / U-FNO operators are expressed
  as `DeepONet(trunk=None, dimension=3)` with a Fourier/UNet/Conv
  `SpatialBranch`.
- Adds `Sin` elementwise sine activation to `physicsnemo.nn`, registered
  in `ACT2FN` so it can be looked up by name (`get_activation("sin")`).
- Adds active-learning recipe for external-aerodynamics surrogates
  (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/active_learning_aero/`). Iteratively
  fine-tunes a GP-augmented GeoTransolver onto an out-of-distribution
  target class by scoring unlabeled candidates with a joint UQ signal
  (GP-vs-integrated-drag disagreement + GP posterior std) and selecting
  the top-`k` per round. Built on the `physicsnemo.active_learning`
  protocols and `physicsnemo.experimental.uq.VariationalGPHead`, with a
  layered structure (generic AL driver / GP-UQ recipe / aero adapter)
  designed for reuse on other UQ-based regression problems.
- Adds `LatentNoveltyQueryStrategy` to the active-learning aero recipe,
  a third acquisition strategy that ranks unlabeled samples by their
  average kNN cosine distance in the encoder's learned geometry latent
  — reusing the same `OODGuard`
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.guardrails.embedded`) that flags
  out-of-distribution inputs at inference time. The guard is calibrated
  on the currently labeled set each round; round 1 falls back to
  class-balanced random because the calibration buffer is empty. New
  public `OODGuard.score_geometry()` method exposes the raw per-sample
  geometry-latent kNN distance as a continuous score for downstream
  consumers (e.g. AL acquisition) without the boolean thresholding /
  warning emission of `OODGuard.check()`.

### Changed

- `physicsnemo.mesh` performance: eliminated host-device syncs on hot paths.
  Cached topological adjacencies now store the `Adjacency` object directly instead
  of reconstructing it (which re-ran its syncing `__post_init__` validation) on every
  lookup — making cached adjacency lookups ~120x faster on GPU (~335us → ~3us for a
  10k-point sphere); the BVH leaf-hit expansion drops two per-traversal-level syncs;
  and the Laplacian smoother reuses its per-iteration buffers in place instead of
  reallocating them.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh.slice_cells` now accepts `None`/`Ellipsis` (keep all
  cells, return self), matching its type hint and `slice_points`;
  `gaussian_curvature_cells` reuses the cached `gaussian_curvature_vertices`
  property instead of recomputing it.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: `validate_mesh(check_self_intersection=True)` now raises
  `NotImplementedError` (the check is unimplemented) instead of silently returning a
  `None` sentinel that masquerades as "no self-intersections found".

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed several silent-wrong-result bugs — `slice_cells`
  carried stale point-level and non-local (`gaussian_curvature`) caches onto the
  sliced mesh; the intrinsic LSQ gradient returned all-zeros for codimension >= 2
  manifolds (now estimates the tangent space via local PCA); `smooth_laplacian`
  returned stale geometry caches after its in-place point update; `transform`
  propagated an incorrect point-normals cache under anisotropic/shear maps; and the
  derived-mesh methods (`compute_point_derivatives`, `compute_cell_derivatives`,
  `cell_data_to_point_data`, `point_data_to_cell_data`) aliased the source mesh's
  mutable `_cache`.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed crash / data-integrity bugs — `project(...)` with
  `transform_point_data`/`transform_cell_data=True` mutated the input mesh in
  place; visualization and `to_pyvista` crashed on autograd-tracked tensors (now
  detached before `.numpy()`); and integer/bool data crashed (`safe_eps` on an
  integer dtype) or truncated via integer division during facet/scatter
  aggregation (now computed in a floating dtype).
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed Loop subdivision pulling open boundaries inward (now
  applies the boundary/crease mask); subdivision zero-filling integer/bool
  `point_data` at new edge vertices (now inherits a parent label);
  non-deterministic orientation flips and over-counted component sizes in
  `repair.fix_orientation`; random point sampling drawing barycentric weights in
  float32 for float64 meshes; and `Mesh.merge` not validating `point_data` /
  `global_data` key consistency.
- Fixed `DefaultTrainingLoop` reading `DistributedManager.device` at the class
  level (a `property` descriptor) instead of `DistributedManager().device`, which
  left the loop's device set to a `property` object under an initialized
  `DistributedManager` (`physicsnemo/active_learning/loop.py`).
- Replaced three plain-string regex / docstring literals containing invalid
  escape sequences with raw-string equivalents
  (`physicsnemo/utils/logging/launch.py`,
  `physicsnemo/metrics/general/calibration.py`,
  `physicsnemo/metrics/general/crps.py`); these were `SyntaxWarning`s today
  and become `SyntaxError`s in Python 3.16.
- Various test cleanups to remove self-inflicted warnings in CI output:
  disabled pytest collection for `TestModelA`/`TestModelB` helpers in
  `test/core/test_registry.py` via `__test__ = False`; migrated
  `test/nn/module/test_interpolation.py` to call the non-deprecated
  `grid_to_point_interpolation` and added a dedicated test for the
  deprecation alias; scoped a `lr_scheduler.step()`-before-`optimizer.step()`
  `UserWarning` filter to a single test in
  `test/optim/test_combined_optimizer.py`; guarded the
  `DistributedManager.initialize()` calls in `test/utils/test_checkpoint.py`
  with `is_initialized()`; and suppressed the import-time
  `ExperimentalFeatureWarning` in `test/datapipes/healda/test_features.py`
  via `warnings.catch_warnings()`.
- Fixed `physicsnemo.utils.get_checkpoint_dir` returning paths with `\`
  separators on Windows (e.g. `.\checkpoints_model`), which was inconsistent
  with the `/`-based paths used elsewhere in the checkpoint utilities and
  broke the `test_get_checkpoint_dir` CI test on Windows. The function now
  always joins with `/`, working uniformly for local paths and `fsspec`
  URIs (`msc://`, etc.) across operating systems.

### Security

### Dependencies

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Adds GLOBE model (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.globe.model.GLOBE`),
  including new variant that uses a dual tree traversal algorithm to reduce the
  complexity of the kernel evaluations from O(N^2) to O(N).
- Adds GLOBE AirFRANS example case (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/globe/airfrans`)
- Adds GLOBE DrivAerML example case (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/globe/drivaer`)
- Adds drop-test dynamics recipe.
- Adds concrete dropout uncertainty quantification for GeoTransolver. Learnable
  per-layer dropout rates enable MC-Dropout inference for uncertainty
  estimates. Disabled by default (`concrete_dropout: false`).
- Adds automatic support for `FSDP` and/or `ShardTensor` models in checkpoint save/load
  functionality
- PhysicsNeMo-Mesh now supports conversion from PyVista/VTK/VTU meshes that may
  contain polyhedral cells.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, adds `Mesh.to_point_cloud()`, `.to_edge_graph()`, and
  `.to_dual_graph()` methods. These allow Mesh conversion to 0D point clouds, 1D
  edge graphs, and 1D dual graphs, respectively, when connectivity information
  is not needed.
- Adds `physicsnemo.mesh.generate` subpackage with `marching_cubes` for
  isosurface extraction from 3D scalar fields, returning a `Mesh` object.
  Supports the NVIDIA Warp backend.
- Adds a type system to PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, allowing annotation of Mesh dimensions
  using notation like `Mesh[2, 3]` for a 2D manifold in 3D space.
- Adds adjacency caching to PhysicsNeMo-Mesh `Mesh` objects, allowing efficient
  reuse of neighbor information.
- Adds `DomainMesh` class for grouping an interior mesh with named boundary
  meshes and domain-level metadata, with passthrough geometric transforms
  (translate, rotate, scale, transform) and data operations.
- Allows selective per-field transformation of `Mesh` objects: `transform_point_data`,
  `transform_cell_data`, and `transform_global_data` now accept `bool | TensorDict`
  (or plain `dict` for convenience).
- Adds `physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing` subpackage with `partition_cells()` for
  creating Voronoi regions around seed points. BVH-accelerated.
- Added support for 1D, 2D, and 3D neighborhood attention (natten) via
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional` interface, with full `ShardTensor` support.
- Added derivative functionals in `physicsnemo.nn.functional` for
  `uniform_grid_gradient`, `rectilinear_grid_gradient`,
  `spectral_grid_gradient`, `meshless_fd_derivatives`, `mesh_lsq_gradient`,
  and `mesh_green_gauss_gradient`.
- Adds `physicsnemo.sym` module for symbolic PDE residual computation
  (`PhysicsInformer`). Users define PDEs via SymPy and select a gradient method
  (`autodiff`, `finite_difference`, `spectral`, `meshless_finite_difference`,
  `least_squares`); spatial derivatives are computed automatically using the
  `nn.functional.derivatives` functionals.
- Ports all physics-informed examples (LDC PINNs, Darcy, Stokes MGN, DoMINO,
  datacenter, xaeronet, MHD/SWE PINO) to the new `physicsnemo.sym` interface,
  replacing the separate `physicsnemo-sym` package dependency. Geometry is now
  handled via `physicsnemo.mesh` and PyVista.
- Added geometry functionals in `physicsnemo.nn.functional` for
  `mesh_poisson_disk_sample`, `mesh_to_voxel_fraction`, and
  `signed_distance_field`.
- Adds embedded OOD guardrail `OODGuard` at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.guardrails.embedded`, optionally
  wired into `GeoTransolver` via a new `guard_config` constructor argument.
  The guard calibrates per-channel global bounds and a geometry-latent
  kNN threshold during training, and emits warnings on out-of-distribution
  inputs at inference.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry` now publicly exposes
  `stable_angle_between_vectors` and `compute_triangle_angles` (previously
  only available via the private `physicsnemo.mesh.curvature._utils`).
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes enables reproducability through `torch.generator`
  utilities.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes now supports `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh` and
  `physicsnemo.mesh.DomainMesh` objects for deserialization, with
  transformations and utilities for mesh-based datasets.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes now support `MultiDataset` construction,
  allowing on-the-fly construction of multi-source composite datasets
  that can be sampled and processed efficiently and coherently
  as one dataset.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes also support random augmentations for
  mesh-based datapipes, leveraging `torch.distributions` for
  broad random distribution support. Mesh and DomainMesh
  datasets allow random translation, scaling, and rotation
  of mesh data in coherent ways, compatible with reproducability
  features of physicsnemo datapipes.
- Adds a new *unified* training recipe for external aerodynamics
  that supports training on multiple datasets (DrivaerML, ShiftSUV,
  HighLiftAeroML, or more, bring your own, mix and match), supports
  training several different models (Domino, Transolver, GeoTransolver,
  Flare, GeoTransolver with Flare-attention, bring your own!).  Leverages
  mesh datasets and non-dimensionalization to enable dataset mixing and
  matching at runtime.  Train with surface or volume data.
- Adds a new `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion` subpackage that
  scales 2D diffusion models to large domains via patch-based training
  and inference. Provides `MultiDiffusionModel2D` (wraps a base model and
  handles state patching, conditioning preprocessing, positional-embedding
  injection, and per-patch output fusion), the
  `MultiDiffusionMSEDSMLoss` / `MultiDiffusionWeightedMSEDSMLoss` losses
  for patch-based DSM training, and `MultiDiffusionPredictor` for
  sampling (plugs straight into `sample()` / `get_denoiser()` and the
  standard solvers). Patching primitives (`BasePatching2D`,
  `GridPatching2D`, `RandomPatching2D`) are exposed under the same
  subpackage and are `torch.compile`-friendly with `fullgraph=True`.
  `MultiDiffusionPredictor` supports memory-efficient inference on
  large domains via `chunk_size` and `use_checkpointing`. The
  subpackage also ships patch-local DPS guidance:
  `MultiDiffusionDPSScorePredictor` (drop-in score predictor that plugs
  into the standard sampling stack),
  `MultiDiffusionDataConsistencyDPSGuidance` for inpainting and sparse
  data assimilation, and `MultiDiffusionModelConsistencyDPSGuidance` for
  generic patch-local observation operators. Use these instead of the
  global `DPSScorePredictor` to run guided sampling on domains that
  would otherwise OOM.
- Adds `"epsilon"` as a supported prediction type throughout the diffusion
  framework, alongside the existing `"x0"` and `"score"` modes. A new
  `PredictorType = Literal["x0", "score", "epsilon"]` alias in
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.base` is wired through losses (`MSEDSMLoss`,
  `WeightedMSEDSMLoss`, and the multi-diffusion losses), preconditioners,
  samplers / solvers, DPS guidance, and noise schedulers, enabling
  end-to-end training and sampling of epsilon-parameterized models.
  Losses gain an `epsilon_to_x0_fn` kwarg used for the epsilon-to-x0
  conversion required during DSM training.
- Adds `DiffusionUNet3D` 3D U-Net diffusion backbone for volumetric data at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.models.diffusion_unets`. Implements the
  `DiffusionModel` protocol. Exposes reusable 3D building blocks
  (`Conv3D`, `GroupNorm3D`, `UNetAttention3D`, `UNetBlock3D`) at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.nn`.
- Added support for Batched radius search, which enables Domino
  and GeoTransolver with local features and batch size > 1.
- Added the underfill recipe.

### Changed

- Improved crash recipe with configurable stats directory.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.sampling.find_nearest_cells` uses a KNN-backed
  implementation, and no longer accepts the `bvh=`, `chunk_size=`,
  `max_rounds=`, or `max_candidates_per_point=` parameters.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (deep imports):** internal `physicsnemo.nn.functional`
  modules were reorganized by category. Public top-level functional imports are
  unchanged, but code importing internal module paths directly (for example
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.knn` or
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.radius_search`) should migrate to
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.neighbors.*`.
- Consolidated Warp interpolation kernels for grid-to-point and point-to-grid
  backends, and added missing kernel/helper docstrings.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, dual-mesh primitives gained closed-form fast paths
  for triangle meshes embedded in 3D. `compute_circumcenters` is up to
  ~10000x faster (e.g. 11 s -> ~1 ms on a 360 K-triangle AirFRANS mesh,
  RTX 4090) by replacing batched `torch.linalg.lstsq` over (2, 3) systems
  with a closed-form cross product, and `compute_vertex_angles` is up to
  ~15x faster on the same meshes by replacing the dimension-agnostic
  Gram-determinant formula with an `atan2(||cross||, dot)` formulation.
  Anything that depends on these (Gaussian curvature, FEM Laplacian,
  cotangent weights, Voronoi areas, smoothing) inherits the speedup. See
  `perf.md` for the full audit.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, BVH construction is faster on GPU.
  `_compute_morton_codes` has a CUDA-specific fused-bits path that
  eliminates the `n_bits` sequential kernel launches of the previous
  bit-loop (5-8x speedup on small / medium meshes), and `BVH.from_mesh`
  reuses the cached `Mesh.cell_centroids` instead of recomputing.
  End-to-end `BVH.from_mesh` is ~2x faster on a 162 K-tet `cube_volume`
  mesh.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, the topology-dedup APIs
  (`categorize_facets_by_count`, `find_edges_in_reference`,
  `remove_duplicate_cells`, `build_adjacency_from_pairs`) gained optional
  `index_bound` / `n_targets` parameters. When the caller passes a strict
  upper bound (typically `mesh.n_points` or `mesh.n_cells`), the implicit
  `tensor.max().item()` GPU sync is avoided and the dedup uses a packed
  int64 unique (via the new internal `unique_index_tuples`) and a single
  composite-key argsort. End-to-end `get_boundary_edges` and
  `cell_to_cells_adjacency` are ~2x faster on practical-size unstructured
  meshes (e.g. 360 K-triangle AirFRANS).
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (deep imports):** in PhysicsNeMo-Mesh,
  `stable_angle_between_vectors` and `compute_triangle_angles` moved from
  `physicsnemo.mesh.curvature._utils` to `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry._angles`.
  The old private path is no longer available; use the
  `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry` re-export instead.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (pre-release rename):** in PhysicsNeMo-Mesh,
  `DomainMesh.apply` was renamed to `DomainMesh.apply_to_meshes`. The
  original name shadowed the recursive `Tensor -> Tensor` `apply` method
  that `@tensorclass` auto-injects, breaking duck-type symmetry with
  `Mesh.apply` for any code that handled both classes. After the rename,
  `dm.apply(tensor_fn)` works as expected (recurses through every leaf
  tensor in `interior`, `boundaries`, and `global_data`); the original
  Mesh-to-Mesh broadcast is now `dm.apply_to_meshes(mesh_fn)`. Early
  adopters of the unreleased `DomainMesh` API should rename their
  `.apply(...)` callsites to `.apply_to_meshes(...)`.
- Refactored the patching utilities under
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.patching`. Patching and fusion
  operations are now more performant and `torch.compile`-friendly (e.g.
  `fullgraph=True`,`error_on_recompile=True`).
- Refactored the `examples/geophysics/diffusion_fwi` full-waveform
  inversion example to use the consolidated `physicsnemo.diffusion` API
  (preconditioners, samplers, losses, DPS guidance) and removed the
  recipe-local copies of these utilities under `utils/`.
- Refactored the `examples/generative/topodiff` recipe to use the
  consolidated `physicsnemo.diffusion` API (`MSEDSMLoss` with
  `prediction_type="epsilon"`, `sample()`, `DPSScorePredictor`) plus a
  recipe-local DDPM scheduler, solver, and classifier guidance. Removed
  the now-unused `Diffusion`, `DatasetTopoDiff`, and `load_data_topodiff`
  abstractions from `physicsnemo.models.topodiff`.
- Significantly expanded CI test coverage for `physicsnemo.diffusion`,
  including new tests for samplers, solvers, preconditioners, losses,
  DPS guidance, multi-diffusion, and patching utilities, plus
  combined-workflow and from-checkpoint round-trip tests. Most tests
  run with `fullgraph=True` and `error_on_recompile` to catch
  `torch.compile` regressions.
- Internal weight initialization in the distributed AFNO layers and the
  `EarthAttention` blocks of `physicsnemo.nn.module.attention_layers` now
  dispatches to `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` directly instead of going
  through frozen in-tree copies of the pre-PyTorch-2.12 inverse-CDF
  implementation. PyTorch 2.12 reimplemented `trunc_normal_` as a
  rejection-sampling loop on top of `normal_()` (see
  [pytorch/pytorch#174997](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/174997)),
  so seeded from-scratch initialization consumes the RNG stream
  differently on 2.12+ vs older versions. Existing trained checkpoints
  are unaffected (loading bypasses init). Forward-accuracy reference
  outputs for `AFNO`, `ModAFNO`, `Transolver`, `FLARE`, and `Pangu` were
  regenerated against the new algorithm. Rather than wiring per-model
  skips, `test.common.validate_forward_accuracy` now uniformly skips on
  `torch < 2.12` (the reference data is locked to that floor via a single
  `_REFERENCE_DATA_MIN_TORCH` constant; bump it when a PyTorch
  release next changes an init/RNG algorithm any forward-accuracy model
  depends on, and regenerate the `.pth` files at the same time).

### Deprecated

- `physicsnemo.utils.mesh` is deprecated and will be removed in v2.2.0. For
  isosurface extraction, use `physicsnemo.mesh.generate.marching_cubes` instead
  of `sdf_to_stl`. For VTP/OBJ/STL file conversion (`combine_vtp_files`,
  `convert_tesselated_files_in_directory`), use VTK or PyVista directly.
- `physicsnemo.nn.module.utils.trunc_normal_` (and its submodule path
  `physicsnemo.nn.module.utils.weight_init.trunc_normal_`) is deprecated
  and will be removed in v2.2.0. It is now a thin wrapper around
  `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` that emits a `DeprecationWarning` on
  call, replacing the frozen in-tree copy of the legacy inverse-CDF
  implementation. Use `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` directly.

### Removed

- The legacy in-tree `trunc_normal_` implementation that lived in
  `physicsnemo/models/afno/distributed/layers.py` (`_trunc_normal_` /
  `_no_grad_trunc_normal_`) is removed. These names were private; all
  in-tree call sites now use `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_`.

### Fixed

- Fixed functional benchmark plot fallback labeling so unlabeled ASV results use
  the same key ordering as the benchmark runner.
- Fixed graph break caused by `FunctionSpec` dispatch (`max(key=)` is not supported by `torch.compile`)
- Fixed bug in Pangu, FengWu attention window shift for asymmetric longitudes
- Fixed a bug in `mesh.sampling.find_nearest_cells`, where a mixup between L2 and L-inf norms
  could cause slightly incorrect nearest-neighbor assignments in highly skewed meshes.
- Fixed TensorDict key-ordering bug in GLOBE's Barnes-Hut kernel that caused
  incorrect results when `tensordict >= 0.12` reordered leaves during
  TensorDict construction from dict literals mixing plain and nested keys.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `from_pyvista` now correctly handles
  `UnstructuredGrid` inputs in newer `pyvista` versions, looking up
  cell-type buckets in `cells_dict` with `np.uint8(pv.CellType.X)` keys
  rather than the `IntEnum` value, and skipping non-numeric VTK arrays
  (strings, objects) when copying point / cell / field data into the
  `Mesh` `TensorDict`s instead of failing the conversion.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, the `Mesh` constructor now preserves data when
  `point_data` / `cell_data` / `global_data` are passed as a non-dict
  `Mapping` (notably PyVista's `DataSetAttributes`). Previously, with
  `tensordict >= 0.12`, the `@tensorclass(tensor_only=True)` auto-init
  silently wrapped such Mappings as `NonTensorData` and dropped every key,
  so e.g. `Mesh(cell_data=pv_mesh.cell_data, ...)` produced an empty
  `cell_data`. `Mesh.__post_init__` now detects this wrapping and unwraps
  the original Mapping before coercing to `TensorDict`. The `tensor_only`
  fast path is preserved, so internal Mesh constructions (slicing,
  transforms, `from_pyvista`) keep their full speed. Backed by new direct-
  construction regression tests, a `cell_data` / `global_data` memmap
  round-trip test, and a committed `.pmsh` golden fixture that locks the
  on-disk format against silent breakage in future changes.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `safe_eps(dtype)` is now capped at
  `torch.finfo(dtype).eps`, which fixes a float16 corner case where the
  previous `tiny ** 0.25` floor exceeded machine epsilon and could
  corrupt fp16 mesh quantities. Ad-hoc `+ 1e-10` denominators in
  `smooth_laplacian` and `compute_quality_metrics` have been replaced
  with the dtype-aware `.clamp(min=safe_eps(dtype))` to avoid silently
  zeroing fp16 weights.
- Fixed a silent bug in loading state from checkpoint for
  FSDP-backed models with `use_orig_params=False` and channels last
  memory format.
- Fixed issues with physicsnemo.nn.functional's `radius_search` that
  caused crashes when used with torch.compile.
- Fixed the sinusoidal positional embeddings formula in `SongUNet` and
  `MultiDiffusionModel2D` so it now follows the standard `sin / cos`
  convention. Affected reference data was regenerated.
- Constructing a `Mesh` (or `DomainMesh`) inside a `torch.compile`-traced
  function no longer raises `AttributeError` / `KeyError` or silently
  produces wrong output. The breakage came from two regressions in
  `tensordict >= 0.12.0` (PR `pytorch/tensordict#1552`), where the
  `@tensorclass` init wrapper's bypass branch silently skipped both
  field-default normalization and `__post_init__` under
  `torch.compile`. We pin `tensordict < 0.12` until the upstream fix
  (`pytorch/tensordict#1708`, `pytorch/tensordict#1709`) ships, and add
  a regression test (`test/mesh/mesh/test_compile.py`) that constructs
  a `Mesh` inside `torch.compile` and reads cached properties, so the
  same bug cannot return on a future pin bump unnoticed.

### Dependencies

- Increments minimum viable PyTorch version to `torch>=2.5.0` to support FSDP better
- Upper-bounds `tensordict < 0.12` to avoid the `torch.compile` regressions
  in `tensordict >= 0.12.0` (see corresponding entry under Fixed).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Refactored diffusion preconditioners in
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.preconditioners` relying on a new abstract base class
  `BaseAffinePreconditioner` for preconditioning schemes using affine
  transformations. Existing preconditioners (`VPPrecond`, `VEPrecond`,
  `iDDPMPrecond`, `EDMPrecond`) reimplemented based on this new interface.
- New `physicsnemo.experimental.nn.symmetry` module that implements building
  blocks that preserve 2D and 3D rotational equivariance using a
  grid-based layout for efficient GPU parallelization, and an emphasis on
  compact `einsum` operations.
- Flare attention support for both Transolver and GeoTransolver models.

### Changed

- PhysicsNemo v2.0 contains significant reorganization of tools.  Please see
  the v2.0-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md to understand what has changed and why.
- DiT (Diffusion Transformer) has been moved from `physicsnemo.experimental.models.dit`
  to `physicsnemo.models.dit`.

### Fixed

- Shape mistmatch bug in the Lennard Jones example

### Dependencies

- CUDA backend is now selected via orthogonal `cu12` / `cu13` extras rather
  than being hardcoded to CUDA 13. Feature extras (`nn-extras`, `utils-extras`,
  etc.) are now CUDA-agnostic and can be combined with either backend, e.g.
  `pip install "nvidia-physicsnemo[cu13,nn-extras]"`. When neither `cu12` nor
  `cu13` is specified, PyTorch is installed from PyPI using its default build
  (currently CUDA 12.8 on Linux). For development with `uv`, use
  `uv sync --extra cu13` (or `--extra cu12`) to select the backend.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- Added mixture_of_experts for weather example in physicsnemo.examples.weather.
  **⚠️Warning:** - It uses experimental DiT model subject to future API changes.

  which has a specific `.forward()` signature
- Examples: added a new example for reservoir simulation using X-MeshGraphNet.
  Accessible in `examples/reservoir_simulation`
- Added abstract interfaces for constructing active learning workflows, contained
  under the `physicsnemo.active_learning` namespace. A preliminary example of how
  to compose and define an active learning workflow is provided in `examples/active_learning`.
  The `moons` example provides a minimal (pedagogical) composition that is meant to
  illustrate how to define the necessary parts of the workflow.
- Added a new example for temporal interpolation of weather forecasts using ModAFNO.
  Accessible in `examples/weather/temporal_interpolation`.

### Changed

- Migrated Stokes MGN example to PyTorch Geometric.
- Migrated Lennard Jones example to PyTorch Geometric.

  and load them with `Module.save` and `Module.from_checkpoint`.
  **⚠️Warning:** - The modules have to be `physicsnemo.Module`s, and not
  `torch.nn.Module`s.
- Support passing custom tokenizer, detokenizer, and attention `Module`s in
  experimental DiT architecture
- Improved Transolver training recipe's configuration for checkpointing and normalization.
- Bumped `multi-storage-client` version to 0.33.0 with rust client.
- Improved configuration for DLWP Healpix (checkpoint directory) and GraphCast (W&B settings).

### Fixed

- Set `skip_scale` to Python float in U-Net to ensure compilation works.
- Ensure stream dependencies are handled correctly in physicsnemo.utils.neighbors
- Fixed the issue with incorrect handling of files with consecutive runs of
  `combine_stl_solids.py` in the X-MGN recipe.
- Fixed the `RuntimeError: Worker data receiving interrupted` error in the datacenter example.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added

- Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model. The DiT model can be accessed in
 `physicsnemo.experimental.models.dit.DiT`. **⚠️Warning:** - Experimental feature
  subject to future API changes.
- Improved documentation for diffusion models and diffusion utils.
- Safe API to override `__init__`'s arguments saved in checkpoint file with
  `Module.from_checkpoint("chkpt.mdlus", override_args=set(...))`.
- PyTorch Geometric MeshGraphNet backend.
- Functionality in DoMINO to take arbitrary number of `scalar` or `vector`
  global parameters and encode them using `class ParameterModel`
- TopoDiff model and example.
- Added ability for DoMINO model to return volume neighbors.
- Added functionality in DoMINO recipe to introduce physics residual losses.
- Diffusion models, metrics, and utils: implementation of Student-t
  distribution for EDM-based diffusion models (t-EDM). This feature is adapted
  from the paper [Heavy-Tailed Diffusion Models, Pandey et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14171>).
  This includes a new EDM preconditioner (`tEDMPrecondSuperRes`), a loss
  function (`tEDMResidualLoss`), and a new option in corrdiff `diffusion_step`.
  &#9888;&#65039; This is an experimental feature that can be accessed through the
  `physicsnemo.experimental` module; it might also be subjected to API changes
  without notice.
- Bumped Ruff version from 0.0.290 to 0.12.5. Replaced Black with `ruff-format`.
- Domino improvements with Unet attention module and user configs
- Hybrid MeshGraphNet for modeling structural deformation
- Enabled TransformerEngine backend in the `transolver` model.
- Inference code for x-meshgraphnet example for external aerodynamics.
- Added a new example for external_aerodynamics: training `transolver` on
  irregular mesh data for DrivaerML surface data.
- Added a new example for external aerodynamics for finetuning pretrained models.

### Changed

- Diffusion utils: `physicsnemo.utils.generative` renamed into `physicsnemo.utils.diffusion`
- Diffusion models: in CorrDiff model wrappers (`EDMPrecondSuperResolution` and
  `UNet`), the arguments `profile_mode` and `amp_mode` cannot be overriden by
  `from_checkpoint`. They are now properties that can be dynamically changed
  *after* the model instantiation with, for example, `model.amp_mode = True`
  and `model.profile_mode = False`.
- Updated healpix data module to use correct `DistributedSampler` target for
  test data loader
- Existing DGL-based vortex shedding example has been renamed to `vortex_shedding_mgn_dgl`.
  Added new `vortex_shedding_mgn` example that uses PyTorch Geometric instead.
- HEALPixLayer can now use earth2grid HEALPix padding ops, if desired
- Migrated Vortex Shedding Reduced Mesh example to PyTorch Geometric.
- CorrDiff example: fixed bugs when training regression `UNet`.
- Diffusion models: fixed bugs related to gradient checkpointing on non-square
  images.
- Diffusion models: created a separate class `Attention` for clarity and
  modularity. Updated `UNetBlock` accordingly to use the `Attention` class
  instead of custom attention logic. This will update the model architecture
  for `SongUNet`-based diffusion models. Changes are not BC-breaking and are
  transparent to the user.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-breaking:** refactored the automatic mixed precision
  (AMP) API in layers and models defined in `physicsnemo/models/diffusion/` for
  improved usability. Note: it is now, not only possible, but *required* to
  explicitly set `model.amp_mode = True` in order to use the model in a
  `torch.autocast` clause. This applies to all `SongUNet`-based models.
- Diffusion models: fixed and improved API to enable fp16 forward pass in
  `UNet` and `EDMPrecondSuperResolution` model wrappers; fp16 forward pass can
  now be toggled/untoggled by setting `model.use_fp16 = True`.
- Diffusion models: improved API for Apex group norm. `SongUNet`-based models
  will automatically perform conversion of the input tensors to
  `torch.channels_last` memory format when `model.use_apex_gn` is `True`. New
  warnings are raised when attempting to use Apex group norm on CPU.
- Diffusion utils: systematic compilation of patching operations in `stochastic_sampler`
  for improved performance.
- CorrDiff example: added option for Student-t EDM (t-EDM) in `train.py` and
  `generate.py`. When training a CorrDiff diffusion model, this feature can be
  enabled with the hydra overrides `++training.hp.distribution=student_t` and
  `++training.hp.nu_student_t=<nu_value>`. For generation, this feature can be
  enabled with similar overrides: `++generation.distribution=student_t` and
  `++generation.nu_student_t=<nu_value>`.
- CorrDiff example: the parameters `P_mean` and `P_std` (used to compute the
  noise level `sigma`) are now configurable. They can be set with the hydra
  overrides `++training.hp.P_mean=<P_mean_value>` and
  `++training.hp.P_std=<P_std_value>` for training (and similar ones with
  `training.hp` replaced by `generation` for generation).
- Diffusion utils: patch-based inference and lead time support with
  deterministic sampler.
- Existing DGL-based XAeroNet example has been renamed to `xaeronet_dgl`.
  Added new `xaeronet` example that uses PyTorch Geometric instead.
- Updated the deforming plate example to use the Hybrid MeshGraphNet model.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-breaking:** Refactored the `transolver` model to improve
  readability and performance, and extend to more use cases.
- Diffusion models: improved lead time support for `SongUNetPosLtEmbd` and
  `EDMLoss`. Lead-time embeddings can now be used with/without positional
  embeddings.
- Diffusion models: consolidate `ApexGroupNorm` and `GroupNorm` in
  `models/diffusion/layers.py` with a factory `get_group_norm` that can
  be used to instantiate either one of them. `get_group_norm` is now the
  recommended way to instantiate a GroupNorm layer in `SongUNet`-based and
  other diffusion models.
- Physicsnemo models: improved checkpoint loading API in
  `Module.from_checkpoint` that now exposes a `strict` parameter to raise error
  on missing/unexpected keys, similar to that used in
  `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict`.
- Migrated Hybrid MGN and deforming plate example to PyTorch Geometric.
